# MediaCleaner
a package of scripts to clean up downloaded media libraries

Requirements:
Windows
PowerShell
7-Zip
Dedicated movie and show folders
One movie or episode per folder

This script assumes that you have 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) installed and configured correctly to work in PowerShell. Be careful with the directories I have set as the paths since they will be unique to your computer
